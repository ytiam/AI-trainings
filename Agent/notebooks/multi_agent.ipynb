    "# Building Multi-Agent AI System Using LangGraph and LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive guide on building **multi-agent workflows** using LangGraph! In this notebook, we'll embark on a journey from a foundational ReAct agent to a sophisticated multi-agent customer support system. We'll explore core LangGraph concepts, leverage its pre-built libraries, and integrate advanced features like human-in-the-loop interactions and long-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a library designed to build stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, chains, and tools. It extends LangChain by allowing you to define sequences of calls (chains) more robustly, with cycles, conditional logic, and the ability to manage complex state transitions. This makes it ideal for creating agentic workflows where multiple `thinking` and `acting` steps are required, or where different specialized agents need to collaborate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Multi-Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent architectures are powerful for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Specialization & Modularity**: Instead of a single, monolithic agent trying to handle everything, a multi-agent system comprises smaller, specialized agents. Each agent is optimized for a specific task or domain (e.g., one for music queries, another for invoice details). This improves accuracy and performance within their specialized area.\n",
    "*   **Flexibility & Scalability**: New capabilities can be added by simply integrating a new specialized agent, without needing to retrain or significantly modify existing agents. Agents can be quickly added, removed, or modified, making the system highly adaptable.\n",
    "*   **Robustness**: If one agent fails or performs poorly in its specific task, it doesn't necessarily bring down the entire system, as other agents can still function. This contributes to a more resilient application.\n",
    "*   **Complex Problem Solving**: Many real-world problems require different types of expertise. A multi-agent system can mimic human team collaboration, breaking down complex queries into sub-problems handled by the most appropriate expert agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Customer Support Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simulate a realistic customer support example for a digital music store. The agent will interact with the [Chinook database](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/), which contains comprehensive information about customers, invoices, and a music catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final architecture will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture Diagram](images/architecture.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the system starts with a **customer verification** step (human-in-the-loop), then **loads user preferences** from long-term memory. A **supervisor agent** then intelligently routes the query to the appropriate specialized sub-agent: either the **music catalog sub-agent** or the **invoice information sub-agent**. Finally, the system **saves any new user preferences** to long-term memory before providing a response.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Short-Term Memory (Checkpointer)**: This preserves the state of a specific conversational thread. It allows the agent to maintain context and pick up where it left off within a *single conversation*. If a user's query requires multiple turns or involves human intervention, the checkpointer ensures the graph's state is saved and can be resumed.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Long-Term Memory (InMemoryStore)**: This allows information to be stored and recalled *between conversations* or across different sessions for the same user. In our scenario, we'll use it to store user preferences, enabling personalization. For example, if a user mentions their favorite music genre, this information can be stored and used in future interactions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our multi-agent system will be composed of specialized sub-agents. We'll start by building two foundational ReAct agents, one from scratch to understand the core components, and another using LangGraph's pre-built utilities for quicker development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Building a ReAct Agent from Scratch: The Music Catalog Sub-Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first sub-agent will be dedicated to handling customer inquiries related to the music store's catalog. This agent will utilize a set of tools to fetch information about artists, albums, tracks, and genres from the Chinook database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework is a popular pattern for building agents that interleave reasoning steps with acting steps (tool usage). The agent `reasons` about what tool to use and `acts` by calling that tool, then `observes` the result to `reason` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Music Sub-Agent Architecture](images/music_subagent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangGraph, the **State** is a critical concept. It acts as the shared memory of the agent, a data structure that is passed between the nodes of your graph. Each node receives the current state, performs its logic, and returns updates to the state, which then becomes the input for the next node. This continuous flow of information through the state allows the graph to maintain context and build up information as it progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our customer support agent, the state will track the following key elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `customer_id`: A string representing the ID of the customer interacting with the agent. This is crucial for personalized queries (e.g., checking invoice history).\n",
    "2.  `messages`: An annotated list of `AnyMessage` objects. This forms the conversation history, including user inputs, agent responses, and tool outputs. `add_messages` ensures that new messages are appended to the list, maintaining the conversational flow.\n",
    "3.  `loaded_memory`: A string that will hold any user preferences or relevant information loaded from the long-term memory store. This allows the agent to tailor responses based on past interactions.\n",
    "4.  `remaining_steps`: A `RemainingSteps` object. This is part of LangGraph's managed state and helps track the number of steps left before a recursion limit is hit, preventing infinite loops in cyclic graphs."

    "\n",
    "In LangGraph, **Nodes** are the fundamental building blocks of your graph. They are essentially Python functions (or JS/TS functions) that take the graph's `State` as input, perform some logic (e.g., invoke an LLM, call a tool, update data), and return updates to the `State`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our ReAct agent, we'll define two primary types of nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`music_assistant` (Reasoning Node)**: This node is an LLM responsible for `reasoning`. It takes the current conversation history and user query, considers the available tools, and decides the next best action. This could be to invoke a tool, or if the query is satisfied, to generate a final response.\n",
    "2.  **`music_tool_node` (Acting Node)**: This node is responsible for `acting`. When the `music_assistant` decides to use a tool, the `music_tool_node` receives the tool call, executes the specified tool function, and then returns the tool's output back to the graph state. LangGraph provides a convenient `ToolNode` utility that automatically handles the execution of tools."

    "\n",
    "Currently, our agent assumes we have the `customer_id` readily available or directly provided in the initial query. In a realistic customer support scenario, we often need to **first verify the customer's identity** before processing sensitive inquiries like invoice details. This verification might involve asking the user for an identifier (e.g., email, phone, customer ID) and then looking it up in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we'll introduce a **human-in-the-loop** component. This means the graph can *pause* execution and wait for additional input from the user (or a human agent) before proceeding. LangGraph's `interrupt` mechanism is perfect for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Human Input Integration](images/human_input.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will add two new nodes to our workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`verify_info` node**: This node will attempt to extract a customer identifier from the user's input and verify it against our database. If found, it updates the `customer_id` in the graph state. If not found or not provided, it prompts the user for the information.\n",
    "*   **`human_input` node**: This is a simple node that explicitly triggers an `interrupt`, pausing the graph execution until the user provides the necessary information to resume.\n",

This is crucial for personalization.\n",

This ensures the agent has relevant context for personalized responses.\n",
    "*   **`create_memory` node**: After the main query is handled, this node will analyze the conversation that just took place. If the customer shared any new music interests, it will update or create a `UserProfile` in the `InMemoryStore`, saving these preferences for future interactions."

    "### Swarm vs Supervisor\n",
    "\n",
    "![Swarm vs Supervisor Comparison](images/supervisor_vs_swarm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap the key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature            | Supervisor Architecture                    | Swarm Architecture                               |\n",
    "| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Control Flow**   | Centralized; supervisor routes queries.    | Decentralized; agents hand off to each other.    |\n",
    "| **Decision-making**| Supervisor decides which agent to call next.| Each agent decides who to hand off to.            |\n",
    "| **Hierarchy**      | Clear hierarchy: Supervisor -> Sub-agents. | Flat, collaborative structure.                   |\n",
    "| **Modularity**     | Add/remove sub-agents by updating supervisor.| Agents need to know about possible handoffs.    |\n",
    "| **Predictability** | More predictable routing.                  | More dynamic, emergent behavior.                 |\n",
    "| **Resilience**     | Supervisor is a single point of failure.   | More resilient to individual agent failures.     |\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between a supervisor and a swarm depends on your use case. If you need strict control and a clear workflow, a supervisor is often better. If your problem benefits from dynamic, collaborative problem-solving and greater adaptability, a swarm might be more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, there's a great video by Lance from our team at LangChain breaking down Supervisor vs. Swarm: [Multi-agent swarms with LangGraph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeyDrn1dSUQ)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluations** are a quantitative and systematic way to measure the performance of your LLM applications, especially agents. They are critical because LLMs don't always behave predictably—even small changes in prompts, models, or inputs can significantly impact results. Evaluations provide a structured method to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify Failures**: Pinpoint where and why your agent is not performing as expected.\n",
    "2.  **Compare Versions**: Quantitatively compare different versions of your application (e.g., after prompt changes, model updates, or architectural shifts).\n",
    "3.  **Build Reliability**: Iteratively improve your agent's quality and ensure it meets desired performance benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "An evaluation typically comprises three core components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **A Dataset**: A collection of test inputs and their corresponding expected outputs (ground truth). This serves as the benchmark against which your application's performance is measured.\n",
    "2.  **An Application or Target Function**: The specific piece of your LLM application (e.g., an agent, a chain, or a node) that you want to evaluate. This function takes an input and returns an output.\n",
    "3.  **Evaluators**: Metrics or models (often LLMs themselves, known as \"LLM-as-a-judge\") that score your target function's outputs against the dataset's ground truth or specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Evaluation Conceptual Diagram](images/evals-conceptual.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to evaluate an agent, depending on what aspect of its performance you want to measure. Today, we will cover three common types of agent evaluations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Final Response Evaluation**: Assess the quality of the agent's ultimate answer to a user query, treating the agent as a black box.\n",
    "2.  **Single Step Evaluation**: Focus on the performance of a specific, critical step within the agent's execution (e.g., whether it correctly selects a tool).\n",
    "3.  **Trajectory Evaluation**: Analyze the entire sequence of steps (the \"trajectory\") an agent takes, assessing whether it follows the expected path of tool calls and internal reasoning."
