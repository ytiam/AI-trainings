    "\n",
    "## ✅ Why It *Sometimes Works*\n",
    "\n",
    "* The denoising process is often **robust enough** that small skips (e.g., sampling every 3rd or 6th step) don’t break the image completely.\n",
    "* Some models (esp. those trained with higher noise schedules or with classifier-free guidance) generalize surprisingly well to subsampling.\n",
