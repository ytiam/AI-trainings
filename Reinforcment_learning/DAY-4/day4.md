## What is Bellman equation btw in its simplest form?

At its **simplest**, the **Bellman equation** says:

> **The value of a state = the immediate reward + the value of the next state (discounted).**

Formally, for a state $s$:

$$
V(s) = \mathbb{E}[ R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s ]
$$

where

* $V(s)$ = value of state $s$ (how good it is to be there),
* $R_{t+1}$ = reward you get after taking an action,
* $\gamma$ = discount factor ($0 \leq \gamma < 1$),
* $S_{t+1}$ = next state,
* Expectation is over all possible transitions.

---

🔹 **Intuition**:
It just breaks the problem into **now + future**.

* “How good is this state?”
* \= “What do I get right away?”
* * “How good will the next state be?”

This **recursive definition** is the backbone of RL.

👉 Example (simplified):

* You’re at a square in Gridworld.
* Bellman equation says:
  *Value of this square = reward here + (discount × average value of the squares you might land on next).*

---

## Do the bellman equation assume that the process is MDP

Yes ✅ — the **Bellman equation assumes the environment is a Markov Decision Process (MDP)**.

Here’s why:

* An **MDP assumption** means the future depends **only on the present state and action**, not on the full history.

  $$
  P(S_{t+1}, R_{t+1} \mid S_t, A_t) 
  $$
* The Bellman equation relies exactly on that:

  * $V(s) = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t=s]$
  * This only makes sense if the transition probabilities and rewards are determined solely by the current state and action.

If the process wasn’t Markov (say, rewards depend on the last 10 states), then the Bellman recursion **wouldn’t hold** unless you redefine the “state” to include enough history to restore the Markov property.

---

👉 In short:

* **Yes, Bellman equations are derived from the MDP framework.**
* If your process isn’t Markov, you can often **redefine the state space** so that it becomes Markov, and then Bellman equations apply again.


## Give me few examples of non MDPs. some real life examples

Good question 👍 — this will help you see why the **Markov property** is an assumption, not always true.

The **Markov property** says:

$$
P(S_{t+1} \mid S_t, A_t) = P(S_{t+1} \mid S_1,\dots,S_t, A_1,\dots,A_t)
$$

i.e., *the next state depends only on the current state + action, not the whole past.*

---

### 🔹 Real-life **Non-MDP Examples**

1. **Stock Market / Financial Trading**

   * Current stock price isn’t enough to predict the next price — trends, volatility, and long historical dependencies matter.
   * A single “state” (today’s price) ignores past correlations, making it non-Markov.

2. **Medical Diagnosis**

   * A patient’s *current symptoms* may not fully capture their health state.
   * Past medical history, lifestyle, or genetics influence outcomes → not Markov unless you encode all history into the “state.”

3. **Weather Prediction (simplified)**

   * Today’s temperature alone doesn’t predict tomorrow’s weather accurately.
   * You need more features (humidity, wind, pressure, past patterns). Without them, the process is non-Markov.

4. **Dialogue / Conversation**

   * If an AI chatbot only looks at the *last message* to respond, it misses context from earlier in the conversation.
   * The conversation state isn’t Markov unless you include the full dialogue history in the state.

5. **Driving with Hidden Factors**

   * Suppose an autonomous car only observes position and speed.
   * If the driver in front is *distracted* or *angry* (hidden factor), the next state (braking or not) depends on more than the visible current state → non-Markov.

---

### 🔹 Key insight

Most real-world processes are **not truly Markov** if you define state naively.

* But in RL, we often **redefine or augment the state space** (e.g., include history, features, hidden info) to *approximate* the Markov property.
* That’s why modern RL often uses **RNNs/Transformers** — they capture history when the environment isn’t strictly Markov.

![BellMan Equation](<Screenshot 2025-09-12 122428.png>)
### Your version of the Bellman equation is different than the version given in the screenshot at equation number 3.12. Why is it?

Great catch 👍 Let’s carefully compare.

---

### ✅ The version I gave you earlier (state-value form)

$$
V(s) = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t=s]
$$

---

### ✅ Sutton & Barto (equation 3.12 in your screenshot)

$$
v_\pi(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)\Big[r + \gamma v_\pi(s')\Big]
$$

---

### 🔹 Why do they look different?

They are actually **the same equation**, just expressed at different levels of detail:

1. **My version** is the compact **expectation form**:

   * “Value = expected immediate reward + discounted value of next state.”
   * Expectation is left implicit.

2. **Sutton’s version** expands the expectation explicitly:

   * Over **actions** chosen under policy $\pi(a|s)$.
   * Over **transition probabilities** $p(s',r|s,a)$.
   * Over **all possible next states and rewards**.

So Sutton’s form is just **more explicit and general**: it shows the full probability distributions over actions, states, and rewards.

---

### 🔹 Example (bridging the two)

Compact expectation form:

$$
V(s) = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1})]
$$

Expanding the expectation:

$$
= \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)\Big[r + \gamma V(s')\Big]
$$

This is **exactly Sutton’s equation (3.12)**.

---

👉 So: **no contradiction** — Sutton’s is the fully expanded definition, mine was the simplified expectation notation. They’re mathematically equivalent.

Perfect 👍 Let’s decode Sutton’s **Bellman equation (3.12)** step by step with a **tiny Gridworld example** so you see how each term works.

---

### 🔹 Equation (3.12) (state-value form under a policy π)

$$
v_\pi(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a)\Big[r + \gamma v_\pi(s')\Big]
$$

This says:

* Start at state $s$.
* Average over all actions you might take (weighted by your policy $\pi$).
* Then average over all possible next states $s'$ and rewards $r$ given that action (weighted by environment dynamics $p$).
* Inside the brackets: **reward now** + **discount × value of next state**.

---

### 🔹 Example: Tiny 2×1 Gridworld

* Two states: **A** (left), **B** (right, terminal).
* Start in **A**.
* Actions: {Right, Left}.
* Rewards:

  * Going Right from A → moves to B, reward = +1.
  * Going Left from A → stays in A, reward = 0.
* Discount factor: $\gamma = 0.9$.
* Policy: $\pi(\text{Right}|A) = 0.5$, $\pi(\text{Left}|A) = 0.5$.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Write Sutton’s Bellman equation

For state $A$:

$$
v_\pi(A) = \sum_a \pi(a|A) \sum_{s',r} p(s',r|A,a)\Big[r + \gamma v_\pi(s')\Big]
$$

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Expand over actions

Two actions possible: Right, Left.

1. **Case 1: Action = Right**

   * Policy probability: $\pi(\text{Right}|A) = 0.5$.
   * Transition: $p(B, +1 | A, \text{Right}) = 1$.
   * Contribution:

     $$
     0.5 \times \big[ 1 + 0.9 \cdot v_\pi(B) \big]
     $$

2. **Case 2: Action = Left**

   * Policy probability: $\pi(\text{Left}|A) = 0.5$.
   * Transition: $p(A, 0 | A, \text{Left}) = 1$.
   * Contribution:

     $$
     0.5 \times \big[ 0 + 0.9 \cdot v_\pi(A) \big]
     $$

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Combine them

$$
v_\pi(A) = 0.5\big[1 + 0.9 v_\pi(B)\big] + 0.5\big[0.9 v_\pi(A)\big]
$$

If B is terminal ($v_\pi(B) = 0$):

$$
v_\pi(A) = 0.5(1) + 0.45 v_\pi(A)
$$

$$
v_\pi(A) - 0.45 v_\pi(A) = 0.5
$$

$$
0.55 v_\pi(A) = 0.5
$$

$$
v_\pi(A) \approx 0.91
$$

---

### 🔹 Intuition

* The value of **A** depends on:

  * Sometimes going Right (get reward 1, then done).
  * Sometimes going Left (stay in A, future matters).
* The Bellman equation expresses this recursive dependence.

---

👉 Now you can see how Sutton’s general formula expands into a **weighted sum over actions, states, and rewards**, and how it matches the compact version I first showed.
