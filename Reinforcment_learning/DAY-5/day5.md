### œÄ(a‚à£s) this gives the probability of taking an action being in a specific state and p(s‚Ä≤,r‚à£s,a) gives the probability of moving to a specific next state and getting a reward, chosen the (state,action) pair. Is my understanding correct?

Exactly ‚úÖ ‚Äî your understanding is spot on.

Let‚Äôs restate clearly:

* **(\pi(a|s))**
  = the **policy**.
  = probability of *choosing action (a)* when the agent is in state (s).

  * Example: If you‚Äôre at square (2,3) in FrozenLake, maybe (\pi(\text{UP}|(2,3))=0.7), (\pi(\text{RIGHT}|(2,3))=0.3).

* **(p(s',r|s,a))**
  = the **environment dynamics / transition model**.
  = probability of *ending up in state (s')* and receiving reward (r), given that you took action (a) in state (s).

  * Example: In FrozenLake (slippery version), if you try ‚ÄúUP‚Äù from (2,3), with probability 1/3 you go UP, 1/3 you slip LEFT, 1/3 you slip RIGHT, each with its own state (s') and reward (r).

---

### Putting them together (Bellman equation)

* First, the agent **chooses** action (a) according to (\pi(a|s)).
* Then, the environment **responds** with next state (s') and reward (r) according to (p(s',r|s,a)).
* The Bellman equation averages over both sources of randomness.

So:

* **(\pi)** captures the agent‚Äôs *decision-making randomness*.
* **(p)** captures the environment‚Äôs *uncertainty*.


### And the goal of a RL problem is to learn these probabilities by doing trial and error and improving the accuracy of these probability estimation over time, right?

Almost ‚úÖ but let me fine-tune it a bit.

In **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**:

* The **environment** already has the true probabilities (p(s', r \mid s, a)) baked in (we don‚Äôt know them explicitly).
* The **agent‚Äôs goal is not to learn those probabilities directly**, but to **learn a good policy (\pi(a \mid s))** that maximizes expected cumulative reward.

Now, depending on the RL method:

1. **Model-based RL**

   * The agent *does* try to estimate (p(s', r \mid s, a)) (the dynamics + reward function) through trial and error.
   * Once it has estimates, it can plan (e.g., dynamic programming).

2. **Model-free RL** (like Q-learning, SARSA, Policy Gradient)

   * The agent doesn‚Äôt bother explicitly estimating (p(s', r \mid s, a)).
   * Instead, it learns:

     * **Value functions**: (Q(s,a)) or (V(s))
     * Or directly optimizes the **policy** (\pi(a|s)).
   * These are learned by trial and error, using sampled transitions.

üëâ So:

* Your statement is correct **for model-based RL**.
* In **model-free RL** (most popular in practice), the agent *implicitly* accounts for those probabilities by updating Q-values or policy parameters from sampled experiences, not by explicitly estimating them.

### As per sutton barto book, the return equation Gt = Rt+1 + Rt+2 + ... or the discounted version of it, exist in a MDP framework. Why is it so? Under Non-MDP will the equation fail?

Excellent and very deep question üëå

Let‚Äôs carefully untangle this.

---

### 1. Why the return (G_t) exists in an **MDP framework**

In Sutton & Barto, the return is defined as:

[
G_t = R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3} + \cdots
]
or discounted:
[
G_t = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}.
]

* This definition itself does **not** require an MDP.
* But when we want to define **value functions** (V(s)) and (Q(s,a)), we need to take **expectations of return given current state (and action)**.

Example:
[
V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi [G_t \mid S_t = s].
]

For this expectation to be **well-defined recursively**, the environment must have the **Markov property**: the distribution of the next state and reward depends only on ((s, a)).

That‚Äôs what allows dynamic programming‚Äìstyle recursion:
[
V^\pi(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s',r} p(s',r|s,a) \big( r + \gamma V^\pi(s') \big).
]

So:

* The return exists mathematically **always**.
* But the nice recursive structure (Bellman equations, value iteration, policy iteration, Q-learning updates) relies on the **MDP assumption**.

---

### 2. What happens in **non-MDPs**?

If the environment is **non-Markovian** (i.e., the future depends on more than just current state):

* The return (G_t) still exists, since rewards still accumulate.
* But we cannot express value functions as a function of **just the current state**.
* Example: In a partially observable environment (POMDP), (V^\pi(s)) is no longer sufficient ‚Äî the agent must use **history** or a **belief state**.

So the Bellman equation breaks down, and the whole recursive machinery of Sutton & Barto doesn‚Äôt directly apply.

---

### 3. Key takeaway

* **Return exists always** (MDP or non-MDP).
* The reason Sutton & Barto frame it in MDP terms:

  * MDPs guarantee that (G_t) can be **decomposed recursively**.
  * This makes RL mathematically and computationally tractable.

---

üëâ In short:

* In **non-MDPs**, the return is still valid, but value functions depending only on the ‚Äúcurrent state‚Äù don‚Äôt make sense. You‚Äôd need to extend the ‚Äústate‚Äù to be the whole history (or belief state), effectively converting it back into an MDP.

---
### Isn't the bellman equation of MDPs, just to simplify the computation and compute load of recursive calculations? Help me to understand

Ah, got it üëç ‚Äî thanks for clarifying.
Your intuition is **partly correct, but not the whole picture**. Let‚Äôs pin this down:

---

### 1. What Bellman equations really do

* They **restate the definition of value functions recursively** using the Markov property.
* Example:
  [
  v_\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}[G_t \mid S_t=s]
  ]
  becomes
  [
  v_\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}*\pi [R*{t+1} + \gamma v_\pi(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t=s].
  ]

So, the Bellman equation is not just for *computation saving* ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **fundamental characterization** of the value function.

---

### 2. Computational benefit

* Yes, once you have this recursive form, you don‚Äôt need to simulate all infinite returns (G_t).
* You can solve for value functions using **dynamic programming**, **iterative updates**, or **linear algebra** instead of brute-force trajectory rollouts.
* So, it *does* massively reduce recursive computation overload ‚Äî but that‚Äôs a **consequence**, not the primary reason it exists.

---

### 3. Why it‚Äôs more than efficiency

* The Bellman equation also provides:

  * **Theoretical foundation** ‚Üí defines optimality (Bellman optimality equations).
  * **Basis for algorithms** ‚Üí Policy iteration, Q-learning, Value iteration all come directly from Bellman equations.
  * **Generalization** ‚Üí lets us relate local (immediate reward + next state value) to global (total return).

---

‚úÖ **Final answer**:
The Bellman equation isn‚Äôt *only* about saving computation ‚Äî it‚Äôs the **core mathematical identity** that links value functions with MDP dynamics. Its computational usefulness (avoiding brute-force recursive sums) is a big motivation, but its deeper role is to **characterize optimality and guide algorithm design**.

---

### In a model free environment, in every iteration of RL, the value functions get updated right?

Yes ‚úÖ ‚Äî in **model-free RL**, the value functions (or action-value functions) are updated *incrementally* at every step (or episode), because you don‚Äôt have the transition model (p(s',r \mid s,a)).

---

### Two common cases:

#### 1. **Monte Carlo (MC) methods**

* Wait until an episode finishes.
* Compute actual return (G_t).
* Update value estimate:
  [
  V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha \big( G_t - V(S_t) \big)
  ]
* Updates happen **once per episode**, but for all states visited in it.

---

#### 2. **Temporal-Difference (TD) methods (e.g., TD(0), Q-learning, SARSA)**

* Update **on every step** using a bootstrapped target:

  * State-value update (TD(0)):
    [
    V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha \Big( R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t) \Big)
    ]
  * Q-learning update:
    [
    Q(S_t, A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \alpha \Big( R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_a Q(S_{t+1}, a) - Q(S_t, A_t) \Big)
    ]

* Updates happen **online**, at every time step.

---

‚úÖ So yes ‚Äî in **every iteration (step or episode depending on method)**, the value functions get updated, gradually improving estimates through trial and error.
