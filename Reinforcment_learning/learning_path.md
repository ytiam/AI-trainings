# Chatgpt suggestion:

Perfect 👍 Let’s build you a **practical-first RL learning schedule (8 weeks)** where every week you’ll write/run code, not just read theory.

## 🗓️ 8-Week Hands-On RL Roadmap

### **Week 1: Foundations**

* ✅ **Concepts:** Agent, Env, State, Action, Reward, Episode.
* 🖥️ **Code:**

  * Install `gymnasium`.
  * Run random agent on `CartPole-v1` & `FrozenLake-v1`.
  * Track total reward per episode.
* 🔧 **Task:** Plot reward distribution of random policy.

👉 Resource: Hugging Face RL Course Unit 0–1.

---

### **Week 2: Tabular RL**

* ✅ **Concepts:** MDP, value function, Bellman equation.
* 🖥️ **Code:**

  * Implement **Monte Carlo policy evaluation** (FrozenLake).
  * Implement **Q-learning** (Taxi-v3).
* 🔧 **Task:** Compare random policy vs learned Q-table in terms of average reward.

👉 Resource: Sutton & Barto Ch. 4–6 (just skim equations).

---

### **Week 3: Exploration & Improvements**

* ✅ **Concepts:** ε-greedy, decaying epsilon, reward shaping.
* 🖥️ **Code:**

  * Add ε-greedy exploration to Q-learning.
  * Test different exploration schedules.
* 🔧 **Task:** Show how exploration impacts Taxi-v3 performance.

👉 Resource: RL-Adventure (tabular examples).

---

### **Week 4: Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**

* ✅ **Concepts:** Function approximation, replay buffer, target network.
* 🖥️ **Code:**

  * Implement **DQN in PyTorch** (CartPole).
  * Add replay buffer.
  * Add target network.
* 🔧 **Task:** Train DQN vs random agent and plot reward curves.

👉 Resource: PyTorch DQN Tutorial.

---

### **Week 5: Policy Gradients**

* ✅ **Concepts:** Policy parameterization, REINFORCE algorithm.
* 🖥️ **Code:**

  * Implement REINFORCE for CartPole.
  * Compare performance vs DQN.
* 🔧 **Task:** Visualize learned policy probabilities (π(a|s)).

👉 Resource: Spinning Up → Policy Gradient section.

---

### **Week 6: Actor-Critic**

* ✅ **Concepts:** Variance reduction, value baseline.
* 🖥️ **Code:**

  * Implement **Actor-Critic (A2C)** in PyTorch.
  * Test on CartPole & LunarLander-v2.
* 🔧 **Task:** Show learning curves of DQN vs A2C vs REINFORCE.

---

### **Week 7: Advanced Algorithms**

* ✅ **Concepts:** Trust regions, continuous action spaces.
* 🖥️ **Code:**

  * Use **Stable Baselines3** to train PPO on LunarLander & continuous env (Pendulum-v1).
* 🔧 **Task:** Compare training stability of PPO vs A2C.

---

### **Week 8: Projects**

* 🎮 **Option 1:** Train PPO agent to play Atari Breakout.
* 🎮 **Option 2:** Train PPO/DDPG agent for continuous robotics control (MuJoCo or PyBullet).
* 🎮 **Option 3:** Build a **custom environment** (e.g., inventory mgmt, traffic signal, elevator scheduling).

## ✅ How to Work Each Week

1. **Day 1–2** → Skim theory (don’t get stuck in equations).
2. **Day 3–5** → Implement minimal working code.
3. **Day 6–7** → Run experiments, plot results, tweak hyperparameters.

This way, you **touch both code + concepts each week**, reinforcing learning.

Do you want me to also prepare a **GitHub-style folder structure with starter code templates** for each week (so you can just fill in missing parts)?
