    "#### The set of all possible outcome of a random experiment is called sample space, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yes, you are absolutely correct!\n",
    "\n",
    "The **set of all possible outcomes** of a **random experiment** is called the **sample space**, and it's usually denoted by the symbol **( S )** or **( \\Omega )**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the experiment is tossing a coin once, then\n",
    "  **Sample space ( S = { \\text{Heads}, \\text{Tails} } )**\n",
    "* If the experiment is rolling a 6-sided die, then\n",
    "  **Sample space ( S = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 } )**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like to go deeper into events, outcomes, or types of sample spaces (finite, infinite, discrete, continuous).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Then any subset of this sample space is called event,  right? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Exactly! ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "An **event** is **any subset** of the **sample space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the sample space is ( S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ) (from rolling a die), then:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The event \"rolling an even number\" is ( E = {2, 4, 6} )\n",
    "* The event \"rolling a number greater than 4\" is ( A = {5, 6} )\n",
    "* Even a single outcome like ( {3} ) is an event (called a **simple event**)\n",
    "\n",
    "And the sample space itself ( S ), and the empty set ( \\emptyset ), are also valid events.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're on the right track! Want to test yourself with a quick exercise?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Any real valued function from the sample space is called random variable right?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yes, you're spot on again! ✅\n",

    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you toss two coins. The sample space is:\n",

    "* ( X(\\text{TH}) = 1 )\n",
    "* ( X(\\text{TT}) = 0 )\n",
    "\n",
    "So here, ( X ) maps each outcome to a real number (0, 1, or 2).\n",
    "That makes it a valid **random variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you want to go over **discrete vs continuous** random variables next.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### And a probability function is associated with a random variable from set of Real numbers to a [0, inf). Is it correct Understanding? \n",

    "- You're **very close**, but let's fine-tune it a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. For **discrete** random variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **probability mass function (PMF)** is associated with the random variable ( X ), and it maps **real values** (that ( X ) can take) to **probabilities** in the range ([0, 1]), such that:\n",

    "\\sum_{x \\in \\text{Range}(X)} P(X = x) = 1\n",

    "* Domain: values that ( X ) can take (subset of ( \\mathbb{R} ))\n",
    "* Range: ([0, 1])\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. For **continuous** random variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **probability density function (PDF)** is associated with ( X ), and it maps real numbers to **non-negative values**, but **not actual probabilities** directly.\n",

    "  * For **continuous**, ( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x), dx = 1 )\n",

    "This abstraction is commonly used in advanced probability/statistics and measure theory, where everything — even discrete cases — is treated via **probability measures** over real-valued functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🧪 1. **Setting the Stage**: What’s the Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're a scientist, and you run an experiment — say, you flip a biased coin 10 times and get 7 heads and 3 tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “What value of the bias (probability of heads, say ( \\theta )) best explains this observed data?”\n",

    "* But here, you flip it:\n",

    "If:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ( \\theta ) is a parameter (e.g., bias of the coin),\n",
    "* ( x ) is the observed data (e.g., 7 heads out of 10),\n",

    "Then:\n",
    "[\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Motivation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* He needed a way to estimate unknown parameters from real data.\n",
    "* Probability couldn't help directly — it predicts data, not parameters.\n",
    "* So he flipped the probability question around and created **likelihood** to “invert the problem.”\n",

    "[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\binom{10}{7} \\theta^7 (1 - \\theta)^3\n",
